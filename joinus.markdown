## Member of the Community

The first step is to be a part of the community. You will have the opportunity to meet 
the people behind ROSEdu, learn more about our projects and get involved in organizing
some of them. If you want to be part of the ROSEdu Community all you have to do is to subscribe to
the [Community mailing list](http://lists.rosedu.org/listinfo/rosedu-general) and join us on

There are plenty of discussions on events and projects where you can get involved. 
We send *Call for help* emails often, so you will find out when you can get to action.

We are fond of diversity and anyone can successfully contribute to our activities.
No matter your gender, faculty, age or experience.
