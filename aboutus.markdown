# About Us

### ROSEdu\'s Mission

**ROSEdu\'s mission is to initiate, support and develop education based on the values of Open Source.**

At ROSEdu, we believe in the importance of education and the learning process. We believe that through communication and collaboration, we can learn from each other, create new things and contribute to existing projects.

Open Source is to us the very environment in which we are active: a network of open people, projects and activities glued together by technology and the Internet, which enables cooperation and a constant exchange of ideas.

### Who we are

ROSEdu is a community of people that are passionate about programming, open source and IT in general.

### Overview

Most of the members of ROSEdu are currently students or graduates of the Politehnica University of Bucharest but we are always welcome new members no matter where they come from.

We belive that everyone should benefit from our work which is why it is available under an open source license. The copyright remains in the posession of the owners.

The majority of our projects are related to the educational environment, but others types of projects might be developed as well depending on the interests of the members.
